The application will now begin to build. This will take a couple of minutes.

The build can be observed using:

[source,bash]
----
oc get build -w
----

Once complete, you can follow the deployment of the application using:

[source,bash]
----
oc get deployment oidc-app -w
----

Alternatively, you can check status directly from the OpenShift web console.
