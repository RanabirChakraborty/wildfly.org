{|
When securing an application with OpenID Connect (OIDC), WildFly https://docs.wildfly.org/{wildfly-version}/Admin_Guide.html#virtual-security-2[automatically]
creates and makes use of a virtual security domain across the deployment. If the application invokes an EJB, additional configuration
might be required in order to propagate the security identity from the virtual security domain. The configuration that's needed
depends on how the EJB that's being invoked is secured. This guide covers the different use cases for propagating an identity
from a virtual security domain.

== Overview of Identity Propagation with OIDC

Additional configuration might be needed in order to propagate a security identity from a virtual security domain depending
on how the EJB that's being invoked is secured.

=== Securing an EJB using the Same OIDC Virtual Security Domain

==== Within the Same Deployment

If a web application secured with OIDC invokes an EJB within the same deployment (e.g., within the same WAR or EAR) and you'd
like to secure the EJB using the same virtual security domain as the web application, no additional configuration is required.

Both of examples that we'll be going through cover this use case.

==== Across Deployments

If a web application secured with OIDC invokes an EJB in a separate deployment (e.g., across EARs) and you'd like
to secure the EJB using the same virtual security domain as the web application, the following configuration is needed:

* A `virtual-security-domain` resource needs to be added in the Elytron subsystem.
* The EJB being invoked needs to be updated with a `@SecurityDomain` annotation that references the `virtual-security-domain`.

For a guided step by step example of how to configure this use case, see <<same-virtual-domain>>.

=== Securing an EJB using a Different Security Domain

If a web application secured with OIDC invokes an EJB (either in the same deployment or in a separate deployment) and
you'd like to secure the EJB using a different security domain from the web application, the following configuration is
needed:

* A `virtual-security-domain` resource needs to be added in the Elytron subsystem.
** This indicates the list of
security domains that a virtual security domain should automatically outflow its security identities to.
* A `trusted-virtual-security-domains` attribute needs to be configured for the `security-domain` that is being
used to secure the EJB being invoked.
** This indicates that the `security-domain` should trust any security identities
that have been established by the specified virtual security domains.

For a guided step by step example of how to configure this use case, see <<different-security-domain>>.

== Example Applications

We will use some simple web applications in this guide that consist of a servlet secured using OIDC. The servlet will invoke an EJB
within the same deployment (i.e., invocation within the same EAR). This EJB will then invoke another EJB located in a different deployment
(i.e., invocation across EARs).

We will use the `oidc-with-identity-propagation` and `oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain` examples from the `elytron-examples` repository:

* https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation[oidc-with-identity-propagation]
* https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain[oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain]

To obtain the examples, clone the `elytron-examples` repository to your local machine:

[source, shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples.git
----

== Start Keycloak

This guide will be making use of Keycloak as our OpenID provider.

To start a Keycloak server in your environment, follow the appropriate guide for your environment
from Keycloakâ€™s https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started[Getting Started] page.

== Secure an EJB Invoked by an OIDC App using a Different Security Domain

For this use case, we'll be using the https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation[oidc-with-identity-propagation] example.

=== Inspect the Example Applications

Let's take a closer look at our example.

* This example consists of two EARs when built: `virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear` and `ejb-basic.ear`.

* Notice that `virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear` contains a https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation/virtual-security-domain-to-domain/web/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/virtual_security_domain_to_domain/web/SecuredServlet.java[servlet]
that invokes an EJB, https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation/virtual-security-domain-to-domain/ejb/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/virtual_security_domain_to_domain/ejb/EntryBean.java[EntryBean],
that's also contained in the same EAR. This EJB doesn't have any explicit security domain configuration. Thus, this EJB will automatically be secured using the same virtual security domain as the servlet.

* The `EntryBean` invokes another EJB, https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation/ejb-basic/ejb/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/ejb_basic/ejb/ManagementBean.java[ManagementBean], that's part of `ejb-basic.ear`.
Notice that `ManagementBean` has a `@SecurityDomain("BusinessDomain")` annotation.

* Because the `ManagementBean` is being secured using a security domain that's different from the virtual security domain that's being
used to secure the web application, we'll need to add configuration to propagate security identities from the virtual security domain to
the `BusinessDomain`.

=== Start WildFly

First, we need to start our WildFly instance. We'll specify a port offset since our Keycloak instance is exposed on
port 8080:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=10
----

=== Configure the Security Domain that will be used to Secure the EJB (BusinessDomain)

We're going to secure the EJB being invoked with a security domain called `BusinessDomain`. To create this security domain,
we'll connect to the WildFly CLI and execute the CLI commands shown below.

[source,bash]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=localhost:10000
----

[source,bash]
----

# Add a filesystem realm called BusinessRealm in the jboss.server.config directory
/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=BusinessRealm:add(path=business-realm-users,relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir)

# Add user alice with Admin role
/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=BusinessRealm:add-identity(identity=alice)
/subsystem=elytron/filesystem-realm=BusinessRealm:add-identity-attribute(identity=alice, name=Roles, value=["Admin"])

# Add a security domain that references our newly created realm
/subsystem=elytron/security-domain=BusinessDomain:add(realms=[{realm=BusinessRealm}],default-realm=BusinessRealm,permission-mapper=default-permission-mapper)

# Update the application security domain mapping in the EJB3 subsystem
/subsystem=ejb3/application-security-domain=BusinessDomain:add(security-domain=BusinessDomain)

reload
----

=== Configure Identity Propagation

First, let's configure a `virtual-security-domain` in the Elytron subsystem to specify that we want to automatically
outflow any security identities established by the virtual security domain to the `BusinessDomain`:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=elytron/virtual-security-domain=virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear:add(outflow-security-domains=[BusinessDomain])
----

Next, let's update the `BusinessDomain` to specify that we want to trust any security identities established by the virtual
security domain associated with `virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear`:

[source,bash]
----
/subsystem=elytron/security-domain=BusinessDomain:write-attribute(name=trusted-virtual-security-domains, value=[virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear])
----

Finally, let's execute a reload:

[source,bash]
----
reload
----

=== Deploy the Example Application to WildFly

We're now going to build and deploy our example.

From the `elytron-examples` directory, run the following commands to build and deploy the `ejb-basic.ear` and `virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear`:

[source,bash]
----
cd YOUR_PATH_TO_ELYTRON_EXAMPLES/oidc-with-identity-propagation/ejb-basic
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10000
----

[source,bash]
----
cd YOUR_PATH_TO_ELYTRON_EXAMPLES/oidc-with-identity-propagation/virtual-security-domain-to-domain
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10000
----

=== Finish Configuring Keycloak

From your `myclient` client in the Keycloak Administration Console,
in the client settings, set `Valid redirect URIs` to http://localhost:8090/virtual-security-domain-to-domain/secured and then click `Save`.

=== Access the Application

From your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8090/virtual-security-domain-to-domain.

Click on `Access Secured Servlet`.

You will be redirected to Keycloak to log in.

Log in using the `alice` user we created earlier.

Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the example application.

The example application outputs information about the user.

You should see the following output:

[source,text]
----
Successfully logged into Secured Servlet with OIDC

Identity as visible to servlet.

Principal : alice

Authentication Type : OIDC

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=false

Identity as visible to EntryBean.

Principal : alice

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=false

Identity as visible to ManagementBean.

Principal : alice

Caller Has Role 'User'=false

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=true
----

Notice the following things:

* The identity as visible to the servlet and the EJB within `virtual-security-domain-to-domain.ear` is `alice` with `User` role. This
shows that the identity from the virtual security domain was successfully propagated to the EJB within the same EAR.

* The identity as visible to the EJB within `ejb-basic.ear` is `alice` with `Admin` role. This shows that the identity
from the virtual security domain was successfully propagated to the `BusinessDomain` that's used to secure the EJB
in a separate deployment.

[[same-virtual-domain]]
== Secure an EJB Invoked by an OIDC App using the Same Virtual Security Domain

For this use case, we'll be using the https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/tree/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain[oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain] example.

=== Inspect the Example Applications

Let's take a closer look at our example.

* This example consists of two EARs when built: `same-virtual-domain.ear` and `ejb-same-domain.ear`.

* Notice that `same-virtual-domain.ear` contains a https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/blob/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain/same-virtual-domain/web/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/same_virtual_domain/web/WhoAmIServlet.java[servlet]
that invokes an EJB, https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/blob/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain/same-virtual-domain/ejb/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/same_virtual_domain/ejb/EntryBean.java[EntryBean],
that's also contained in the same EAR. This EJB doesn't have any explicit security domain configuration. Thus, this EJB will automatically be secured using the same virtual security domain as the servlet.

* The `EntryBean` invokes another EJB, https://github.com/wildfly-security-incubator/elytron-examples/blob/main/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain/ejb-same-domain/ejb/src/main/java/org/wildfly/security/examples/ejb_same_domain/ejb/WhoAmIBean.java[WhoAmIBean], that's part of `ejb-same-domain.ear`.

* Because we want to secure the `WhoAmIBean` with the same virtual security domain that's being
used to secure the web application, we'll need to add configuration to accomplish this.

=== Start WildFly

First, we need to start our WildFly instance. We'll specify a port offset since our Keycloak instance is exposed on
port 8080:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=10
----

=== Configure the Virtual Security Domain that will be used to Secure the EJB

We're going to secure the EJB being invoked with the same virtual security domain that's being used
to secure the web application with OIDC. We first need to connect to the WildFly CLI and add a `virtual-security-domain`
resource in the Elytron subsystem as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=localhost:10000
----

[source,bash]
----
# Add a virtual security domain resource for the same-virtual-domain.ear application
/subsystem=elytron/virtual-security-domain=same-virtual-domain.ear:add()
----

=== Configure Identity Propagation

Next, let's update the `WhoAmIBean` to indicate that we want to secure it using the same virtual domain
that's being used to secure `same-virtual-domain.ear`:

[source,java]
----
@SecurityDomain("same-virtual-domain.ear")
public class WhoAmIBean implements WhoAmI {
    ...
}
----

=== Deploy the Example Application to WildFly

We're going to build and deploy our example.

From the `elytron-examples` directory, run the following commands to build and deploy the `ejb-same-domain.ear` and `same-virtual-domain.ear`:

[source,bash]
----
cd YOUR_PATH_TO_ELYTRON_EXAMPLES/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain/ejb-same-domain
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10000
----

[source,bash]
----
cd YOUR_PATH_TO_ELYTRON_EXAMPLES/oidc-with-identity-propagation-same-domain/same-virtual-domain
mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dwildfly.port=10000
----

=== Finish Configuring Keycloak

From your `myclient` client in the Keycloak Administration Console,
in the client settings, set `Valid redirect URIs` to http://localhost:8090/same-virtual-domain/secured and then click `Save`.

=== Access the Application

From your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8090/same-virtual-domain.

Click on `Access Secured Servlet`.

You will be redirected to Keycloak to log in.

Log in using the `alice` user we created earlier.

Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the example application.

The example application outputs information about the user.

You should see the following output:

[source,text]
----
Successfully logged into Secured Servlet with OIDC

Identity as visible to servlet.

Principal : alice

Authentication Type : OIDC

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=false

Identity as visible to EntryBean.

Principal : alice

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=false

Identity as visible to ManagementBean.

Principal : alice

Caller Has Role 'User'=true

Caller Has Role 'Admin'=false
----

Notice the following things:

* The identity as visible to the servlet and the EJB within `same-virutal-domain.ear` is `alice` with `User` role. This
shows that the identity from the virtual security domain was successfully propagated to the EJB within the same EAR.

* The identity as visible to the EJB within `ejb-same-domain.ear` is `alice` with `User` role. This shows that the identity
from the virtual security domain was successfully propagated to the EJB in a separate deployment.
