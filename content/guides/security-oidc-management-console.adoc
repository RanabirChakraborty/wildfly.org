= Securing the WildFly Management Console with OpenID Connect
:summary: Learn how to secure the WildFly management console with the Keycloak OpenID provider.

You can secure the WildFly Management Console with OpenID Connect (OIDC) using the Keycloak
OpenID provider. When the WildFly Management Console is secured using OIDC, this means that when a user attempts to
access the console, they will be redirected to the Keycloak OpenID provider's login page. Upon successful
authentication, the user will then be redirected back to the WildFly Management Console. This guide
explains how to configure this.

== Start Keycloak

This guide will be making use of Keycloak as our OpenID provider.

To start a Keycloak server in your environment, follow the appropriate guide for your environment
from Keycloakâ€™s https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started[Getting Started] page.

== Configure Keycloak

. Log into the `Keycloak Admin Console`.

. Create a new realm called `wildfly-infra`. For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-creating-a-realm_server_administration_guide[create a realm].

. Create a new client as follows:
* `General Settings`:
** *Client type* (or *Client Protocol*, depending on your Keycloak version): `OpenID Connect`
** *Client ID*: `wildfly-console`
* `Capability config`:
** *Authentication flow*: `Standard flow`, `Direct access grants`
* `Login settings`:
** Set the *Valid redirect URIs* using the URI that will be used to access the WildFly Management Console.
Since we will use a port offset of 10 when starting WildFly in this guide, we will set the `Valid redirect URIs` to http://localhost:10000/console/*.
** Set the *Web Origins* using the management port for our WildFly instance, e.g., http://localhost:10000.

+
For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_oidc_clients[Manage OpenID Connect clients].

. Click `Save` to save the client.

. Create a second new client as follows:
* `General Settings`:
** *Client type* (or *Client Protocol*, depending on your Keycloak version): `OpenID Connect`
** *Client ID*: `wildfly-management`
* *Capability config*:
** *Authentication flow*: This client will be a bearer-only client, be sure to *uncheck* `Standard flow` and *uncheck* `Direct access grants`.
* *Login settings*: Leave the fields blank.

+
For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_oidc_clients[Manage OpenID Connect clients].

. Click `Save` to save the client.

. *[Optional]* If you want to configure WildFly to use https://docs.wildfly.org/{wildfly-version}/Admin_Guide.html#RBAC[Role Based Access Control], add a role called `Administrator`. For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#assigning-permissions-using-roles-and-groups[create a role].

. Add a new user named `alice`. For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide[create a user].

. Once the new user has been created, set a password for this new user from the `Credentials` tab.

. *[Optional]* If you want to configure WildFly to use https://docs.wildfly.org/{wildfly-version}/Admin_Guide.html#RBAC[Role Based Access Control], from the `Role Mapping` tab, assign `alice` the `Administrator` role. For more information, see the Keycloak documentation on how to https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-assigning-role-mappings_server_administration_guide[assign a role] to a user.

== Configure Elytron OIDC Client

Now that we've configured our OpenID provider, there are a couple things that need to be configured in the
`elytron-oidc-client` subsystem to secure the WildFly Management Console with OIDC.

First, we need to add a `secure-deployment` resource that references the `wildfly-management` client that was created in the previous section.

A `secure-server` that references the `wildfly-console` client is also needed.

We can use the following commands to add the required configuration:

First, we need to start our WildFly server instance. Notice that we're specifying a port offset here
since our Keycloak instance is already exposed on port 8080:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=10
----

Next, we can connect to the WildFly CLI and then execute the commands below:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=localhost:10000
----

[source,shell]
----
# Configure the Keycloak provider
/subsystem=elytron-oidc-client/provider=keycloak:add(provider-url=http://localhost:8080/realms/wildfly-infra)

# Create a secure-deployment in order to secure the management interface with bearer token authentication
/subsystem=elytron-oidc-client/secure-deployment=wildfly-management:add(provider=keycloak,client-id=wildfly-management,principal-attribute=preferred_username,bearer-only=true,ssl-required=EXTERNAL)

# (Optional) Enable RBAC where roles are obtained from the identity
/core-service=management/access=authorization:write-attribute(name=provider,value=rbac)
/core-service=management/access=authorization:write-attribute(name=use-identity-roles,value=true)

# Create a secure-server to ensure that the WildFly Management Console will redirect to the Keycloak OpenID provider for log in
/subsystem=elytron-oidc-client/secure-server=wildfly-console:add(provider=keycloak,client-id=wildfly-console,public-client=true)

reload
----

== Accessing the WildFly Management Console

With the above configuration now in place, let's access http://localhost:10000/console. We will be redirected to
the Keycloak login page. We can log in using the `alice` user that we created earlier. Upon successful authentication,
we will be redirected back to the WildFly Management Console.

== What's next?

This guide has shown how to secure the WildFly Management Console with OIDC. To learn
more about OIDC configuration, check out the https://docs.wildfly.org/{wildfly-version}/Admin_Guide.html#Elytron_OIDC_Client[Elytron OIDC Client]
documentation.
