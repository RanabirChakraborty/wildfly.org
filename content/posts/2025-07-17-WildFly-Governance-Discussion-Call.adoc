We're working hard on adopting a new governance model for the WildFly projects, and we'd love to have your input.

To that end, we'll be hosting a call (Google meet) a week from today, July 24, 9 AM EDT, to discuss the topic. It would be great to see you there and hear your thoughts!

The call is shown on the https://www.wildfly.org/events/[events, window=_blank] page. 

Details:

I encourage you to have a look at my https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org/thread/XPIXPQ5FCGZRRKPR43ZURTKJ5Y2VWWE5/[call-for-input, window=_blank] 
from a couple weeks ago and the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2i17R6VtqGeslKlyH6lWVIQix0-QCiMa_6naq1tn-c/edit?tab=t.0[draft document, window=_blank] I discussed there. 
The more that people are familiar with the background the more we can focus on the call on moving things forward.

Discussion in advance, either here on the https://lists.jboss.org/archives/list/wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org/thread/XPIXPQ5FCGZRRKPR43ZURTKJ5Y2VWWE5/[wildfly-dev thread, window=_blank] 
or in comments on the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2i17R6VtqGeslKlyH6lWVIQix0-QCiMa_6naq1tn-c/edit?tab=t.0[governance doc draft, window=_blank] are more than welcome.

See you there!
