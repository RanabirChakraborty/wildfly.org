The 8.1.0.Final version of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been released.

For people who are not familiar with the WildFly Bootable JAR, I strongly recommend that you read
this link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/10/19/bootable-jar-2.0-released/[blog post] that covers it in detail.

This plugin version is to be used when building WildFly Bootable JAR for WildFly 27 (that has just been link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2022/11/09/WildFly27-Final-Released/[released]).

The latest documentation of the plugin can be found link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/[here].

## New features and examples

### JDK11 dependency

When packaging an application with WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin, JDK11 is now required as the minimal JDK version.

### Examples evolved to Jakarta EE 10

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/8.1.0.Final/examples[examples] have been evolved to depend on Jakarta EE 10 specification that WildFly 27 now supports.

### Remote dev watch

Emmanuel Hugonnet described this new feature in link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2022/09/14/Remote-dev-watch/[this] bog post when it was
first released in the 8.0.0.Alpha2 plugin release.

### Dev watch improvements

#### Ignore transient files

This link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues/333[enhancement] allows you to ignore some file updates that were initiating a repackaging/redeploy of your application.
Hidden files and files ending with '~' (generally created by your IDE) are now ignored by default.
You can use the plugin option `ignorePatterns` to ignore more files.

#### Watch multiple source directories

This link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues/330[enhancement] has been reported by the community.

The watcher now looks for directory paths defined in the `${project.compileSourceRoots}` property.
In case you are using `maven-build-helper` plugin to add more sources to be compiled,
call  `mvn process-sources wildfly-jar:dev-watch` to have the extra source roots to be watched.

#### Optimized watch of web files

This link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues/326[enhancement] has been reported by the community.

Updating `html, xhtml, jsp, css` files no more implies a redeploy of the application.
Any change done to these files is immediately reflected in the deployed application.
You can use the `web-extensions` plugin option in order to identify files that should benefit from this feature.

#### Deprecation of the Keycloak OIDC client adapters

The WildFly client adapters for keycloak have been deprecated. This link:https://www.keycloak.org/2022/02/adapter-deprecation[blog post] covers it in detail.

The usage of the link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/keycloak/keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack/[keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack] Galleon feature-pack
has been replaced by the `elytron-oidc-client` Galleon layer defined by WildFly. The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/8.1.0.Final/examples/keycloak[keycloak example] is superseded by the
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/8.1.0.Final/examples/elytron-oidc-client[elytron-oidc-client] one.

## To conclude

Finally we would really appreciate if if you would keep us posted with your feedback and new requirements. (You can log these as new
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues[project issues].) This will help us evolve the WildFly Bootable JAR experience in the right direction.

Thank-you!
