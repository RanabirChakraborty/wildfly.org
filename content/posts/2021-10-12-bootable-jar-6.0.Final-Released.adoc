The 6.0.0.Final version of the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been released.

For people who are not familiar with the WildFly Bootable JAR, I strongly recommend that you read
this link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/10/19/bootable-jar-2.0-released/[blog post] that covers it in detail.

## New examples to highlight new Galleon layers introduced in WildFly 25

For each new release of the WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin we are upgrading the dependency of the
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/6.0.0.Final/examples[examples] to the latest WildFly release and highlight
new features that you can use when building WildFly Bootable JARs.

For 6.0.0.Final, we have added two new examples to cover some new Galleon layers that are of particualr importance for Wildfly Bootable JAR packaging.

### Automatic generation of self signed certificate

Up to now, in order to configure HTTPS when using elytron, we had to include a keystore in the Bootable JAR during packaging.
During development phases we generally don't really care of the content of the keystore (and generating one implies extra steps...).
WildFly 25 introduces the ``undertow-https`` Galleon layer that adds an elytron secured ``https-listener``
that generates a self signed certificate on first connection.

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/6.0.0.Final/examples/https[https example]
has been evolved with the ``self-signed`` profile to provision a server that makes use of the ``undertow-https`` Galleon layer.


### OpenID Connect (OIDC) native support

Up to now, as highlighted in the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/6.0.0.Final/examples/keycloak[keycloak example],
in order to secure a deployment using link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] we had to provision both WildFly
Galleon feature-pack and Keycloak OIDC adapter feature-pack.
Starting with WildFly 25, we are now relying on the WildFly native OIDC support and are deprecating
the use of the Keycloack Galleon feature-pack.

WildFly 25 introduces the ``elytron-oidc-client`` Galleon layer to provision the ``elytron-oidc-client`` subsystem that allows to interact
with OIDC compliant authorization servers (such as the link:https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] server).

This native support is very similar to the Keycloack one. Migrating from using Keycloak Galleon adapter to using WildFly OIDC native support
when building a Bootable JAR is a matter of:

* Removing the Keycloak OIDC adapter feature-pack (``org.keycloak:keycloak-adapter-galleon-pack``) from the plugin configuration.
* Replacing the ``keycloak-client-oidc`` Galleon layer by the ``elytron-oidc-client`` Galleon layer in the plugin configuration.
* Change the ``<auth-method>KEYCLOAK</auth-method>`` to ``<auth-method>OIDC</auth-method>`` in your ``web.xml`` file.
* If you were using ``WEB-INF/keycloak.json`` file you would need to rename it to ``WEB-INF/oidc.json`` and update its
content by following the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/25/Admin_Guide.html#Elytron_OIDC_Client[OIDC client subsystem documentation].
* If you were calling WildFly CLI scripts to update the subsystem configuration, you will need to adjust the management operations.
More information can be found in the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/25/Admin_Guide.html#Elytron_OIDC_Client[OIDC client subsystem documentation].

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/6.0.0.Final/examples/elytron-oidc-client[elytron-oidc-client example] covers
the steps required to use this new Galleon layer.

## To conclude

Finally we would really appreciate if if you would keep us posted with your feedback and new requirements. (You can log these as new
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues[project issues].) This will help us evolve the WildFly Bootable JAR experience in the right direction.

Thank-you!
