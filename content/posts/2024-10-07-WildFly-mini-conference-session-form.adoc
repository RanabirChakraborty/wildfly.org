Hello, WildFly Community!

We are excited to share that after the success of our first WildFly Mini Conference earlier this year, we are planning a new edition for November!

The inaugural conference was an incredible experience, bringing together WildFly developers and the entire community for productive discussions and learning. We are eager to replicate this success, and we want your help to make the next event even better.

We would love to hear which topics you would like to see covered in the conference sessions. Your feedback is crucial to us, and we want to ensure the event meets everyone's expectations and interests.

Please take a moment to share your suggestions by filling out our https://forms.gle/mAj7dDvECeaWp1WM7[form]. We will be collecting responses until next Monday, October 14th.

We look forward to hearing from you and seeing everyone at the next WildFly Mini Conference!

Best regards,

Flavia
