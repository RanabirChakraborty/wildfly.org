==  WildFly 25 S2I Docker images

The WildFly S2I (Source-to-Image) builder and runtime Docker images for WildFly 25
have been released on link:https://quay.io/organization/wildfly[quay.io/wildfly].

For complete documentation on how to use these images using S2I, OpenShift and Docker,
refer to the WildFly S2I link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/blob/master/README.md[README].

== Important changes to mention in this release

We have been evolving the s2i builder image to reflect part of the main changes that occurred in
link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/10/05/WildFly25-Final-Released/[WildFly 25].

In particular the s2i image content is impacted by the removal of ``legacy`` security:

* Changes in the default server configuration:
** Now secured with ``elytron``.
** Security configuration based on legacy ``security-realms`` has been removed.
** ``security`` subsystem and extension have been removed.
* Impact on SSL configuration based on environment variables:
** ``elytron`` is now used by default to configure SSL. The env variable ``CONFIGURE_ELYTRON_SSL=true`` is no more needed.
* Impact on Keycloak integration:
** By default when configuring Keycloak OIDC and SAML adapters ``elytron`` was already in use. Nothing changes there.
** If you were using the env variable ``SSO_FORCE_LEGACY_SECURITY=true`` to rely on the legacy security subsystem,
the server will fail to start, you will need to remove this env variable and rely on ``elytron`` integration.

== Anticipating a future support for OpenID Connect

In this new release we are deprecating the usage of the ``keycloak`` Galleon layer and automatic configuration
based on link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-cekit-modules/blob/master/jboss/container/wildfly/launch/keycloak/module.yaml[environment variables.]

We are planning in a future release to rely on the link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14017[new WildFly subsystem]
that is providing a native support for OpenID Connect allowing to interact with Keycloak server but with also other servers compatible with the OIDC protocol.

Stay tuned!
