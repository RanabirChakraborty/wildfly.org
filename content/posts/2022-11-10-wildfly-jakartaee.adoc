== Reasons to get involved with the Jakarta EE Specification teams

You are a developer that uses the WildFly (Jakarta EE) application server to create/update applications that meet
your users needs.  Reason #1 is to participate in developing future Jakarta EE releases.  From adding a new feature to
a specification, to implementing that new feature.  You can also help by adding TCK tests for new features as well.

Whether you contribute a small or large amount of time, every contribution helps!

The more that you participate in the Jakarta EE communities, the more you will understand how Jakarta EE releases are done.

Sign the link:https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse contribution agreement (ECA)] when you are ready to contribute a pull request.
You will want to sign the ECA with the same email address as the one associated with your github account that you use
for creating Jakarta EE pull requests.

== Browsing/joining the various Jakarta EE mailing lists

== Accessing the specification documents (PDF/HTML) for various specifications

=== Browse the link:https://jakarta.ee[jakarta.ee] page.
The link:https://jakarta.ee[jakarta.ee] page contains many useful subpages, such as the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications[specification]
with all the technology specifications (html/pdf document that describes the specification, javadoc).
For example link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1[https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1 contains the Jakarta Persistence 3.1 specification documents, JavaDoc, Schema documents, Test Compatibility Kit, Maven coordinates.]

Another example, link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws[Jakarta RESTful Web Services] shows the various
releases of Jakarta RESTful Web Services but also note the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jaxrs[project button link]
which shows you interesting information about that project such as link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.rest/who[the list of committers and who leads the project].  The project committers are responsible for reviewing/merging pull requests (e.g. changes) to the Specification repository.

Another important page to note is the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.rest/developer[Developer Resources page]
which has the link:https://github.com/jakartaee/rest[Specification github repository link].

You should `fork` a few of the various Jakarta EE Specification repositories such as link:https://github.com/jakartaee/rest[github.com/jakartaee/rest]
which contain the source for the Jakarta RESTful Web Services API and SPEC documents.  Forking a repository on https://github.com/[https://github.com/YOUR_NAME] means creating a copy of a repo in your personal github account.  You can make EE Specification improvements with your fork and create a pull request for the upstream (original) repo that you forked.

The next blog will give more details about contributing to Jakarta EE and how that can help WildFly + you.

Weâ€™d love to hear feedback from you at the
link:https://groups.google.com/g/wildfly[WildFly forum], the next blog in this series will try to answer
any questions you post in response.
