Many thanks to all participants of the first WildFly Mini Conference!

Our first WildFly Mini Conference took place on March 6. We had four talks on the https://www.wildfly.org/conference/[agenda] and many interesting questions and feedback. The feedback we have received so far has been very positive and has encouraged us to organize similar events for the community in the future. Stay tuned!
