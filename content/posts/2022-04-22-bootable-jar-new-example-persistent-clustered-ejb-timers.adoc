synopsis: A new Bootable JAR Maven plugin example is available - Persistent clustered EJB timers

The new release of the WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin (7.0.1.Final) contains a
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/7.0.1.Final/examples/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers[new example]
to demonstrate how to build an application that employs clustered EJB timers, which currently rely on a JDBC based
persistence storage.

All examples in WildFly Bootable JAR Maven plugin 7.0.1.Final have been updated to use 26.1.0.Final.

## Use case
The example use case is related to automatic timers in clustered environments. In such a scenario all the running
application instances will execute the scheduled method, i.e. each timer would be executed multiple times, thus
breaking the application logic.

Persistent timers can be used in the above case to avoid such behavior in clustered environments, since the WildFly
timer service implementation allows for the user to configure a JDBC based persistent storage for EJB timers.

This is a mean for timer executors to synchronize so that a given timer execution is performed by exactly one of the
running application instances.

Such capabilities are provided by the related https://docs.wildfly.org/26.1/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.ejb[EJB Galleon layer]
and require specific configuration, which is included in the example.

## Persisting timers to a database service

The example application defines an automatic timer which is executed every 10 seconds. It requires for one Postgresql
instance and two replicas of the example application to be deployed on OpenShift.

In order to achieve the behavior described above, a database service needs to be deployed beforehand - see the
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/7.0.1.Final/examples/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers#example-steps[example instructions] -
and the following two configuration aspects must be taken into account.

### Connecting to a JDBC based persistence storage

Similar to the https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/main/examples/postgresql[Postgresql example],
this is achieved by adding the `postgresql-datasource` Galleon layer to the Bootable JAR application
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/blob/7.0.1.Final/examples/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers/pom.xml#L46[configuration].

```xml
<!-- ... -->
<feature-packs>
    <feature-pack>
        <location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#${version.wildfly}</location>
    </feature-pack>
    <feature-pack>
        <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
        <artifactId>wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack</artifactId>
        <version>${version.wildfly.datasources.galleon-pack}</version>
    </feature-pack>
</feature-packs>
<layers>
    <layer>cloud-server</layer>
    <layer>ejb</layer>
    <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer>
</layers>
<!-- ... -->
```

This layer provides the application with all the bits needed to connect a Postgresql data source, including a default
JNDI entry.

The application must as well include a
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/blob/7.0.1.Final/examples/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml[JPA persistence unit definition]
, in order to define the data source connection properties:

```xml
<persistence-unit name="primary">
    <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/PostgreSQLDS</jta-data-source>
    <properties>
        <!-- Properties for Hibernate -->
        <property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect"/>
        <!-- ... -->
    </properties>
</persistence-unit>
```

### Setting the EJB timer service store

The `ejb3` subsystem must be configured so that timers can be persisted to Postgresql, since the default behavior
would use a local, file system based, storage.

This is achieved by configuring the bootable JAR through a
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/blob/7.0.1.Final/examples/scripts/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers.cli[CLI script].

The script will do the following:

* add a new `database-data-store` resource, which is referencing the datasource JNDI entry installed by the
`posgresql-datasource` Galleon layer, to the `ejb3` subsystem `timer-service`:
```
/subsystem=ejb3/service=timer-service/database-data-store=ejb-timers-ds:add(datasource-jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/PostgreSQLDS, database=postgresql, partition=ejb-timers-ds-part)
```

* set the `ejb3` subsystem `timer-service` resource `default-data-store` attribute to the name of the newly created
datasource:
```
/subsystem=ejb3/service=timer-service:write-attribute(name=default-data-store, value=ejb-timers-ds)
```

## Building and deploying on Openshift via Helm Chart for WildFly

The new example also shows how to deploy the application on OpenShift by using https://helm.sh/[Helm] and the
https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/[Helm Chart for WildFly].

A cluster of the example Bootable JAR application instances is created on OpenShift, according to the
https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/blob/7.0.1.Final/examples/ejb-persistent-clustered-timers/helm.yaml[helm.yaml]
definition. Here is where we define the environment variables needed to connect to a database service, so that Helm will
add them to the final deployment.

## In conclusion

EJB timers are a popular feature, and their usage in clustered architectures has some peculiar configuration and
execution aspects. The new example demonstrates how to configure a WildFly Bootable JAR application in order to
allow for unique timer execution in a clustered environment.
