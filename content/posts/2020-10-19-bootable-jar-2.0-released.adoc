As we link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/06/18/Bootable-jar-Wildfly-20/[introduced] few months ago,
we have been working on a "Fat JAR" packaging for WildFly. We are pleased to announce that the 2.0.0 Final version of the
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/[WildFly bootable JAR Maven plugin] has been released.

WildFly 21, that has just been released (you can check the link:https://www.wildfly.org/news/2020/10/13/WildFly21-Final-Released/[announcement]),
fully supports this new way of packaging applications.

A bootable JAR allows you to package both the server and your application deployment
inside a single JAR file and execute it with a simple
command such as ```java -jar myapp-bootable.jar```.

IMPORTANT: There is no need to re-design your application to have it executed inside a bootable JAR.
Developing an application packaged as a bootable JAR is not different from developing an application for a traditional
WildFly server installation using Maven.

## WildFly installation strategies

Along side the link:https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/[WildFly zip installation] and
link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Galleon_Guide.html[Galleon provisioning], the bootable JAR Maven plugin
introduces a new way to install a WildFly server and package your applications.
In order to help you identify the more appropriate installation strategy,
the WildFly documentation introduces a new link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Installation_Guide.html[Installation Guide]
that helps you choose the best approach according to your application needs.

## WildFly Bootable JAR

To help you start with this new packaging, we have defined a link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html[WildFly Bootable Guide]. This guide summarizes
the steps required to get started. For a detailed documentation of the Maven Plugin
usage, you can read the link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/[Maven plugin documentation].

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples[example Maven projects]
are a good place to start practicing with the Maven plugin.

The link:https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tree/21.0.0.Final[WildFly quickstarts]
that cover Eclipse MicroProfile features have been evolved with the 'bootable-jar' and 'bootable-jar-openshift' Maven profiles allowing
you to use the bootable JAR plugin.

## Using Maven

Packaging your application inside a bootable JAR is done when building your application using Maven.
This is done by adding an extra build step to your Maven application pom.xml file.

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        ...
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>package</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

Then call ```mvn package``` to build both your deployment and the bootable
JAR ( ```target/<app name>-bootable.jar``` file) that contains it.

The details on how to configure the build of a bootable JAR can be found in the
link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/[Maven plugin documentation].

## Composing a WildFly Server

### Galleon layers

The Maven plugin depends on link:https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/[Galleon]
trimming capabilities to build a tailored server.

From the plugin configuration element, you need to provide the WildFly Galleon feature-pack and the list of Galleon layers
you want to include/exclude.

The WildFly Galleon feature-pack is a maven artifact that contains everything needed to dynamically provision a server.

A WildFly Galleon
layer is a name that identifies a server capability (e.g.: jaxrs, ejb, microprofile-config, jpa) or an aggregation of such capabilities.
A layer captures a server capability in the form of:

* A piece of server XML configuration (e.g.: extension, configured subsystem, interfaces) that describes the capability.
* A set of JBoss modules that implements the capability.

When you are using a layer, it delivers these pieces of information in order for Galleon to assemble a server containing only the required configuration and JBoss modules.

WildFly Documentation contains a link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#wildfly_layers[description] of the WildFly Galleon layers.

An example of a plugin configuration needed to compose a server to run typical REST applications with support for distributed sessions:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  ...
  <feature-pack-location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)</feature-pack-location> (1)
  <layers> (2)
    <layer>jaxrs-server</layer> (3)
    <layer>web-clustering</layer> (4)
  </layers>
</configuration>
----

(1) In this plugin configuration extract, we are retrieving the latest WildFly Galleon feature-pack installed in the
 ```org.jboss.universe:community-universe``` Galleon universe. In case you would like to provision a specific version of the server,
you would need to specify the server version, for example ```wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#21.0.0.Final```

(2) The included set of layers.

(3) link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.jaxrs-server[jaxrs-server] is a foundational layer which provides capabilities
required to build typical REST applications as well as core WildFly capabilities like the logging subsystem and a secure remote management interface.

(4) link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.web-clustering[web-clustering] is a layer that provides Infinispan-based web session clustering.

IMPORTANT: You are strongly advised to check the WildFly Galleon layers link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#wildfly_layers[documentation] in order to
identify the Galleon layers that will fit your application needs.

### Third-party Galleon layers

The plugin allows you to combine Galleon layers from multiple sources. A source of Galleon layers
must be a Galleon feature-pack designed to be usable with WildFly.

For example, the project link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack[wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack]
defines a Galleon feature-pack that contains layers for postgresql, mysql and oracle drivers and datasources.

In order to compose a server from multiple source use the ```<feature-packs>``` configuration element. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  ...
  <feature-packs>
    <feature-pack>
      <location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#21.0.0.Final</location>
    </feature-pack>
    <feature-pack>
      <groupId>org.wildfly</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0.Final</version>
    </feature-pack>
  </feature-packs>
  <layers>
    <layer>cloud-server</layer> (1)
    <layer>postgresql-datasource</layer> (2)
  </layers>
</configuration>
----

(1) link:https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Bootable_Guide.html#gal.cloud-server[cloud-server] comes from the WildFly Galleon feature-pack.

(2) ```postgresql-datasource``` comes from the link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack/[wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack] Galleon feature-pack.

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/postgresql[postgresql example]
shows how to combine Galleon layers from multiple sources.

## Developer Experience

A strong focus has been put on "Developer Experience", in particular when it comes to
development efficiency and development for cloud.

### Cloud support

#### Adapting the server configuration to OpenShift

To properly operate in an OpenShift context, a server such as WildFly requires
configuration tuning in order to adapt to the cloud execution context
(e.g.:socket binding, HA cluster protocol, logging, health checks).
This tuning is automatically applied when you are using the plugin to build
applications for OpenShift.

When building an application to be deployed on OpenShift you need to add the ```<cloud>```
configuration element.

[source,xml]
----
  <configuration>
    ...
    <cloud/>
  </configuration>
----

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/web-clustering[web-clustering] example
shows how to build a cluster of bootable JARs running on OpenShift.

The details on how to configure a bootable JAR for cloud execution can be found in the
link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/#wildfly_jar_configuring_cloud[Configuring the server for cloud execution] chapter of the Maven plugin documentation.

#### Zero configuration with the Eclipse JKube plugin

The link:https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/[JKube] plugin automates build and deployment
of your application for OpenShift or Kubernetes.
By combining the WildFly bootable JAR and JKube plugins you can achieve "zero configuration"
for application deployment. No Openshift resource creation, no docker image creation,
just let the plugin runs!

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-jar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <feature-pack-location>wildfly@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe)#21.0.0.Final</feature-pack-location>
        <layers>
          <layer>cloud-server</layer>
        </layers>
        <cloud/>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
           <goal>package</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.jkube</groupId>
      <artifactId>openshift-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>resource</goal>
            <goal>build</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
      <configuration>
        <enricher>
          <config>
            <jkube-service>
              <type>NodePort</type>
            </jkube-service>
          </config>
        </enricher>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

Then call ```mvn oc:deploy``` to build your deployment, create a bootable JAR and deploy it onto openshift.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are logged in to your OpenShift Cluster prior to calling ```oc:deploy```.

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/jkube[jkube] example
shows how to use the WildFly bootable JAR and JKube Maven plugin.

The link:https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin[JKube plugin documentation] contains
information on how you can customize liveness and readiness probes.

### Dev mode

In order to speed-up the development of your application, the Maven plugin offers
the ```wildfly-jar:dev``` goal that builds and starts the bootable JAR only once.
When you re-package your application, it will get automatically re-deployed in
the running server.

The details on how to use the ```dev``` goal can be found in the
link:https://docs.wildfly.org/bootablejar/#wildfly_jar_dev_mode[Development mode] chapter of the Maven plugin documentation.

## Server configuration

In case the default configuration that Galleon layers bring is not complete,
the plugin allows you to fine tune the packaged server.

### WildFly CLI scripts

Although Galleon layers contains commonly used server configuration elements,
it can be required to fine tune the server. The WildFly CLI tooling
has been integrated into the Maven plugin in order to apply management operations
during build. That is done by defining one or more CLI script files
containing the list of management operations you want to see executed during packaging.
For example:

A CLI script to add the ```org.foo.demo``` logging logger, set its level and configure the console handler to print log messages of all levels:
----
/subsystem=logging/logger=org.foo.demo:add
/subsystem=logging/logger=org.foo.demo:write-attribute(name=level,value=ALL)
/subsystem=logging/console-handler=CONSOLE:write-attribute(name=level,value=ALL)
----

The plugin configuration extract used to set the CLI script to be executed:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  ...
  <cli-sessions>
    <cli-session>
      <script-files>
        <script>scripts/logging.cli</script>
      </script-files>
    </cli-session>
  </cli-sessions>
----

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/logging[logging example]
shows how to configure the logging subsystem using WildFly CLI.


### Packaging extra content

Sometime you need to package content along with the server (e.g.: a keystore, some properties files).
The server packaged inside a bootable JAR uses the exact same
file system layout as a WildFly installation. The plugin allows you to specify a directory
(layout similar to a WildFly home directory) that gets copied into the packaged server.

For example, to copy ```mykeystore.jks``` to the ```standalone/configuration```
directory, create the directory ```<project base dir>/my-custom-content```
that contains ```standalone/configuration/mykeystore.jks``` and reference it
from the plugin configuration. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  ...
  <extra-server-content-dirs>
    <extra-content>my-custom-content</extra-content>
  </extra-server-content-dirs>
</configuration>
----

The link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/https[https example]
shows how to package extra content.


## Testing with Arquillian

link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-arquillian[WildFly Arquillian] 3.0 contains support for a WildFly bootable JAR
allowing you to test deployments with Arquillian.

The ```org.wildfly.arquillian:wildfly-arquillian-container-bootable``` adapter for arquillian supports:

* Execution of tests that run as a client against a running bootable JAR.
* Execution of tests that run inside a running bootable JAR but with some limitations.
The bootable JAR to test must be a Hollow JAR (a JAR that doesn't contain any deployment).
There is no support yet to repackage an existing deployment to contain the classes of the deployment created by the test.

The https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/tree/2.0.0.Final/examples/arquillian[arquillian examples] show how to
use WildFly arquilian to test deployments running inside a bootable JAR.

## To conclude

We hope that you are seeing an interest in this new WildFly application packaging;
keep us posted with your feedback and new requirements (that you can log as new
link:https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-jar-maven-plugin/issues[project issues]).

Thank-you.
