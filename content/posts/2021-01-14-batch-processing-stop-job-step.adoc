Batch jobs are long-running background processing tasks, and therefore it's
common that user may need to pause or stop the execution.  WildFly, which
implements batch processing through its jberet component based on JSR 352
and https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.batch[Jakarta Batch Specification],
offers a variety of ways to achieve that requirement.  This post will
demonstrate how to stop a running job execution, or individual step execution,
and some design and implementation consideration.

## Properly stop a running job execution

Batch spec defines a standard API for stopping a running job execution:
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/batch/operations/JobOperator.html#stop-long-[javax.batch.operations.JobOperator#stop]

As stated in its https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/batch/operations/JobOperator.html#stop-long-[javadoc],
calling `JobOperator.stop()` sends a stop request to the batch container, which tries its best effort to stop
the running job execution. So it's important to implement batch application that properly responds to a stop request.
In the following sections, I'll explain what it entails for the two different types of steps: batchlet step and chunk step.

### Stop a running job execution that contains batchlet step

A batchelt step represents a free-form, opaque task that is fully controlled by the batch application. The batch container
has no chance to intervene once the batchlet starts its processing. So the batchlet class is responsible for providing
a way to stop itself, if it wants to support graceful stop. That's why `javax.batch.api.Batchlet` interface declares a
`stop()` method that a batchlet class must implement.

In the example batchlet class below, once it receives a stop request in its `stop()` method, it sets the `toStop` flag
to `true`. Its `process()` method periodically checks this flag to determine if it needs to stop processing.

Note that bathlet `stop()` method is called asynchronously while the batchlet `process()` method is running in a
different thread. And the batchlet class should be implemented to properly handle concurrency.

[source,java]

@Named
public class Batchlet1 implements Batchlet \{
    private final AtomicBoolean toStop = new AtomicBoolean();

    @Override
    public String process() throws Exception \{
        String exitStatus = "BATCHLET1_COMPLETED";
        while (true) \{
            if (toStop.get()) \{
                exitStatus = "BATCHLET1_STOPPED";
                break;
            }
            // perform batchlet task, such as downloading and copying files, sending emails, etc.
        }
        return exitStatus;
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() throws Exception \{
        toStop.set(true);
    }
}

After the batch application is deployed to WildFly, you can start and stop a job execution in WildFly CLI:

[source,text]
----
# To start a new job execution
#
/deployment=numbers-chunk.war/subsystem=batch-jberet:start-job(job-xml-name=numbers)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => 1L
}

# To stop the running job execution
#
/deployment=numbers-chunk.war/subsystem=batch-jberet:stop-job(execution-id=1)
{"outcome" => "success"}
----

The above `stop-job` CLI operation calls `JobOperator.stop(jobExecutionId)` behind the scene, and eventually the
batchlet `stop()` method is called to receive the stop request.

The following CLI commands checks the status of the stopped job execution, and a stopped job execution can be
restarted from where it left off.

[source,text]
----
# To check the status of the stopped job execution:
#
/deployment=numbers-chunk.war/subsystem=batch-jberet/job=numbers/execution=1:read-resource(include-runtime, recursive)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => \{
        "batch-status" => "STOPPED",
        "create-time" => "2020-10-29T19:33:13.843-0400",
        "end-time" => "2020-10-29T19:33:30.258-0400",
        "exit-status" => "STOPPED",
        "instance-id" => 1L,
        "last-updated-time" => "2020-10-29T19:33:30.258-0400",
        "start-time" => "2020-10-29T19:33:13.853-0400"
    }
}

# To restart the previously stopped job execution:
#
/deployment=numbers-chunk.war/subsystem=batch-jberet:restart-job(execution-id=3)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => 4L
}
----

You can also perform all the above operations in WildFly Management Console. For example, the following
screenshot shows the UI to stop a job execution:

### Stop a running job execution that contains chunk step

A chunk step is basically a read-process-write loop and naturally supports stop operation. The batch container can
intervene at certain junctures amid the iterations. So unlike a batchlet step, there is no required method to implement
in order to support stop.

However, since a graceful stop will wait for the current chunk to complete, the chunk step
should choose a suitable chunk size (configured in `item-count`, `time-limit`, or custom checkpoint policy in job xml).

If the chunk size is too big, and the stop request arrives shortly after the current chunk starts, it may take a long time
for the current chunk to complete before the batch container can safely stop the current step execution. On the other hand,
a small chunk size results in more frequent checkpointing and quicker response to stop request at the expense of processing
speed.

## Properly stop an individual running step

The previous section describes ways to stop the entire job execution. You may be wondering if there is a way to stop
an individual step only while allowing the rest of the job to continue. Since this is slightly deviates from the standard,
you cannot use `JobOperator.stop(jobExecutionId)` or `Batchlet.stop()` to achieve that. Instead, I would consider this
a special case of normal execution, which should be implemented by the batch application itself.

### Stop an individual running batchlet step

Batchlet class can watch for some condition to determine if it should stop its processing. It can exit its `process()`
method with different exit status to signal different outcomes to subsequent steps. For example, `Batchlet1` below
polls the system property `job1.batchlet1.stop`; once it's set to true, `process()` method returns with exit status
`BATCHLET1_STOPPED`.

Similarly, the condition can be a marker file in the file system, a column value in a database table, a shared state
in a single bean, etc.

Once the batchlet is stopped this way, the batch status of the step will be `COMPLETED`, and its exit status will be
`BATCHLET1_STOPPED`. The job execution will continue to the next step configured in job xml.

[source,java]
----
@Named
public class Batchlet1 implements Batchlet \{
    @Override
    public String process() throws Exception \{
        String exitStatus = "BATCHLET1_COMPLETED";
        while (true) \{
            if (shouldStop()) \{
                exitStatus = "BATCHLET1_STOPPED";
                break;
            }
            // perform batchlet task
            // Thread.sleep(5000);
        }
        return exitStatus;
    }

    private boolean shouldStop() \{
        return Boolean.getBoolean("job1.batchlet1.stop");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() throws Exception \{
        // implement stop() method to respond to incoming request
        // to stop this batchlet step and entire job execution
    }
}
----

In WildFly CLI, you can set and unset a system property as a flag to batch application:

[source,text]
----
# set system property in WildFly as a flag to stop the step execution
#
/system-property=job1.batchlet1.stop:add(value=true)
{"outcome" => "success"}

# clean up afterwards and remove the system property
#
/system-property=job1.batchlet1.stop:remove()
{"outcome" => "success"}
----

### Stop an individual running chunk step

Stopping an individual running chunk step is more complicated than a batchlet step. When implement this case as
a special case of normal processing, a possible strategy is:

* A graceful stop should wait for the current chunk to complete, and then stop the next chunk. The batch application can poll certain
    condition in `javax.batch.api.chunk.listener.ChunkListener#beforeChunk` method, and save the condition, e.g.,
    in `javax.batch.runtime.context.StepContext#setTransientUserData`.
* `javax.batch.api.chunk.ItemReader#readItem` can check the condition from `javax.batch.runtime.context.StepContext#getTransientUserData`,
    and if true, return null. This will cause the chunk step to complete normally as if there is no more data to read.

Once the chunk step is stopped this way, the batch status of the step will be `COMPLETED`, and its exit status will be
`COMPLETED` unless reset by the batch application. The job execution will continue to the next step configured in job xml.

## Summary

In this post we went through ways to stop either a job execution or an individual step execution. It's possible to
combine them, so the batch application can support graceful stop of both the entire job execution and any individual step.

In most cases, I'd recommend designing your batch application, adhering to the batch spec and leveraging the well-defined
stop behavior. It makes your batch application and workflow easier to understand and maintain. Standard stop operation
also supports restarting the previously stopped job execution from where it left off (e.g., stopped step or checkpoint).

When some batch applications really need to stop an individual step, the design choice and implementation should be
well documented to convey the justification and implications. As this type of stop is disguised as a normal execution,
it does not support restart. Care should be taken to avoid data loss and data corruption.
