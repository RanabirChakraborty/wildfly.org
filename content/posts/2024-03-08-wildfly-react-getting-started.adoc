As part of an upcoming development item I am going to be working with a React application deployed to the WildFly application server and invoking Jakarta RESTful Web Service endpoints to interact with the server side of the application.

I thought others might find it useful to see the steps I have taken. This blog post describes my steps up until the point I have the default React application deployed to WildFly, I may then follow up with some blogs of my subsequent steps.
