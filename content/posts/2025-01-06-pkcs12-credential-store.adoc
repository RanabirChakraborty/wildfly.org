The default credential store used in WildFly from WildFly Elytron is the KeyStoreCredentialStore which is backed by a Java KeyStore to hold the credentials.

This in turn defaults to using the JCEKS KeyStore format, this blog post is to illustrate how we can configure this to use a PKCS#12 store instead both in WildFly and when using the elytron-tool CLI tool directly.
