I'm pleased to announce that the new WildFly and WildFly Preview 23.0.0.Beta1 releases are available for download at https://wildfly.org/downloads.

The WildFly 23 development cycle has been a bit shorter than our typical three months, as we've reduced this one some to see if we can get on a rough cadence of Final releases in March/June/September/December. That works well for avoiding releases during the peak summer and year end holiday periods. And the cycle was even shorter in practice due to the normal year end slowdown.

But we got a lot done!

The biggest thing we've done is update all our of Eclipse MicroProfile implementations to the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/releases/tag/4.0[MicroProfile Platform 4.0] versions. We've also added tech preview support for link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging/releases/tag/1.0[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 1.0].

There are lots of other features and fixes in WildFly 23 Beta1. I'll wait for the Final release in a couple weeks to get into more details, but the release notes for the release are link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313721&version=12352712[here], with issues fixed in the underlying WildFly Core beta listed link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12315422&version=12352710[here].

Please try it out and give us your feedback, while we get to work WildFly 23 Final!

Best regards,

Brian
