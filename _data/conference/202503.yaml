    start: "14:55"
    end: "15:40"
    type: talk
    abstract:
      - "We'll discuss and demonstrate how to use Ansible to manage and make evolve, in fully automated fashion, our WildFly infrastructure. For instance, we'll see how to change the clustering configuration, smoothly and automatically, using Ansible. WildFly's cluster capabilities are some of the most powerful features of the app server. It’s ability to leverage multicast to form itself is also quite appreciated by developers, but sometimes creates problems in production, where ops teams prefer to forbid such network communication. With this context in mind, this presentation and demonstration will show how to use Ansible to both set up a cluster of WildFly instances, but also dynamically change the running cluster from using multicast to tcp, with just one playbook run."
