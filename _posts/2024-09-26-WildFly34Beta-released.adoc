= WildFly 34 Beta is released!

I'm pleased to announce that the new WildFly 34.0.0.Beta1 release is available for download at https://wildfly.org/downloads.

As can be seen from the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/releases/tag/34.0.0.Beta1[Release Notes] a lot of maintenance and
component upgrades have been included in this release but I would also like to call out some of the following highlights:

* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19306[WFLY-19306]] -- move from ORM 6.4.x to 6.6.x
* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19632[WFLY-19632]] -- Hibernate Search 7.1.x to 7.2.x
* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19298[WFLY-19298]] -- FasterXML Jackson from 2.15.x to 2.17.x

Within the WildFly Preview distribution we also have:

* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19397[WFLY-19397]] -- Jakarta Data
* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19589[WFLY-19589]] -- MP REST Client 4.0
* [https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-19464[WFLY-19464]] -- User boms for WildFly Preview
