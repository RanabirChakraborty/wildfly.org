title: WildFly Java Microservices on Kubernetes
---
:page-liquid:

== In these guides, you will learn how to create simple WildFly Java Microservices and run them on Kubernetes.

=== Intro

In this mini-serie, we will focus on getting started with WildFly Java Microservices on link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes];

We will start showing how-to create a link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker Image] containing our WildFly Java Microservice;

Then, we will show how-to run the link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker Image] on link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes];

After that, we will show how-to create WildFly Java Microservices on link:https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] that are capable of doing common things like connecting to a Database or interacting with a remote JMS Broker;
